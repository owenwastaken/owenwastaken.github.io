            <p><strong>Note: This article is still expanding, check back later for more content!</strong></p>

<p>In January 2023, my high school was getting rid of over a hundred old calculators. Around half were mismatched
scientific and 4-function calculators, and the other half consisted of graphing calculators from the early and mid
1990s. Most of the graphing calculators are Texas Instruments TI-82, so this article will be focused on them, but I do
plan on making other posts.</p>

<p>After replacing the dead batteries every single TI-82 turned on and functioned, but some had malfunctioning screens.</p>

<h1 id="overclocking">Overclocking</h1>

<p>This section is based on
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220303160216/http://richfiles.solarbotics.net/Turbo82.html">this archived webpage</a>.</p>

<p>There is a 26pf capacitor labeled <strong>C7</strong> on the top right of the TI-82’s motherboard. When this is replaced with a 15pf
capacitor, the speed of the calculator increases by 2-2.5x.</p>

<p>Here is the resistor before and after replacement:

<p>And here is a speed comparison between a stock TI-82 (left), and an overclocked TI-82 (right):</p>
<video src="/assets/videos/calculatorperf.webm" class="auto-scale" loop="" autoplay=""></video>

<h1 id="connecting-to-computer">Connecting to computer</h1>

<p>The TI-82 and TI-85 introduced the ability to connect to another calculator or to a computer to share programs.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>The TI-82 (and TI-85) used the TI Graph-link adapter, which connected to the calculator’s link port and to a computer’s
9 or 25-pin serial port. Luckily, this serial adapter can be converted to USB (shown below).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/graphlinkadapter.webp" class="auto-scale" alt="Photo of TI-Graph Link adapter attached to a serial to USB adapter" /></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>The TI-Graph Link™ software only supports very old versions of Microsoft Windows based on DOS, and some ancient versions
of Mac OS. I chose to run the software in an MS-DOS virtual machine with Windows 3.1 since I already have experience
with the platform.</p>

<p>If you want to replicate my virtual machine, use the <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/ms-dos/622">MS-DOS 6.22</a> and
<a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-3/31">Windows 3.1</a> images from WinWorldPC, and use this archive of the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/TiGraphLink">TI Graph Link Software</a>. For transferring files I decided to use a physical
Floppy Drive since I had one lying around. Here is my Proxmox configuration file (I would recommend editing the config
file after creating a VM through Proxmox).</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>Both CRASH and ASH allow you to create and load programs written in Z80 assembly. In the near future I plan on creating
some basic programs in assembly and stretching the limits on what can be run on a TI-82.</p>
